Team Gocky - CodeBuzz

Required Python Packages
- Django
- python-twitter (and dependencies listed on below URL)
  https://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/
  In the event that dependencies cannot be satisfied the
  web app will still run (import in try/except), just
  without the automated twitter posting of new users and
  snippets. This was the case during the Demo in BO720.

Running instructions:
Executing
$ python manage.py runserver
in the codebuzz directory is sufficient.

Restoring the database:
$ zcat sqlite3.dump.gz | sqlite3 sqlite3.db
If zcat is not available please decompress the gz and run
$ cat sqlite3.dump | sqlite3 sqlite3.db
This will re-add as many entries as possible. It is also
able to completely recreate the database to the version
specified in the dump in the event of an accidental rm or
corruption.
For the purposes of completeness, a backup dump can be created
by running
$ echo '.dump' | sqlite3 sqlite3.db | gzip -c > sqlite3.dump.gz
