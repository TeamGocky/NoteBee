\maketitle

\begin{abstract}

This report documents the specification and design of CodeBuzz,
a web-application for posting code snippets. The aim of the application is
to facilitate programming language learning by exposing beginners to
example programs written by industry experts and academics, and to
aid reuse by providing a store of solutions to commonly recurring
problems in software engineering. 
\end{abstract}

\section{Aim of Application}

CodeBuzz is a code snippet oriented application that allows users to submit code
in a variety of programming languages. This code is categorised based on the
code's language, and function (e.g. sorting algorithm). This categorisation
will allow other users to search for code snippets (e.g. Python Bubble Sort)
and have returned to them a list of matching snippets. These can be ordered
by popularity or user rating.

When a user views a code snippet they have the option to copy the snippet into
their clipboard or comment and rate the snippet.

The application can be used by novice coders looking for examples of common
language functions and can be used by intermediate/expert programmers to supply
their own examples, and rate others. Academics may also find this of use as
it can provide a convenient source of example code (which may or may not be
good code, both useful in this context).

\subsection{Functionality}
\label{sec:functionality}

The site will operate similar to any collaborative web-based application
where users of the site need not be registered in order to contribute
to the site content. The functionality is detailed in the lists below.

The following functionality is available to both registered and
non-registered users:

\begin{itemize}
\item Code snippets have their syntax highlighted.
\item Snippet hit rate/popularity.
\item Categorised code snippets by language and function.
\item Ability to search for code snippets based on language and
function.
\item Textual copy-to-clipboard.
\item Downloadable source code.
\item Links to other code snippets.
\end{itemize}

The following functionality is only available to registered users:
\label{sec:restrict}

\begin{itemize}
\item User can comment on the code snippets, e.g. reviewing the
correctness/usefulness of the code snippet.
\item User can rate a code snippet on a five star scale.
\item User profile which stores bookmarked snippets.
\item Social network integration (such as Twitter).
\end{itemize}

The design goals and functionality requirements are definitely achievable
within the time frame for the project, even with our lack of experience in
Django and web development. Even though the goals are realistically achievable
there was little sacrifice of complexity as the application has a broad use of
web technologies and includes an external API, Twitter.

\section{Client Interface}

\subsection{Wireframes}

Figure \ref{fig:blankPage} shows what the user will be greeted with when they
first access the page. The large blank text box is there to try and have the
user contribute to the code database.

Figure \ref{fig:anonsnippet} shows an anonymous snippet being posted by a
visitor to the website who has chosen not to log in. An example of the basic
layout and the syntax highlighting capabilities are shown in the figure.

Figure \ref{fig:joe} shows a logged in user posting a snippet. The user's
name is shown and there are also links to his profile, bookmarks, and other
user-specific data.

Figure \ref{fig:LoggedInViewJane} shows a user called Jane logged in and viewing
a snippet posted by an anonymous user. There is rating and comments section
with a text box for Jane to add in her own comment if she wishes. The page
scrolls as the comments are not necessarily immediately available above the
fold.

Figure \ref{fig:viewCategories} shows a user called Jane logged in and viewing
the snippet categories. Snippets fit into two categories: language, and type.
The view is identical if the user isn't logged in, with the obvious exception
of the upper bar. The upper bar would look like what was shown in Figure
\ref{fig:anonsnippet}.

Figure \ref{fig:viewAfterSubmission} shows a user called Joe viewing a snippet
he has just posted.

\subsection{Design Goals}

The number one design goal is to make the user interface minimalist
such that the user is not overwhelmed by the application. As can be
seen in the wire frames described above, the application will have a simple
home screen both for registered and non-registered users.

\subsection{A Walk through: Submit a code snippet in C}
\label{sec:walkthrough}

A simple walk through for the user Joe (see Section~\ref{sec:joe}
entering his C code snippet as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:joe} is given
below:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Joe is presented with the blank home screen and is not currently logged
in.
\item Joe logs in using his user details.
\item Joe is presented with the home screen again.
\item Joe selects the C programming language from the language drop-down
menu.
\item Joe proceeds to write his C code into the main window.
\item Joe selects the `Data Structures' category from the category
drop-down menu.
\item Joe is finished creating his code snippet and clicks the `Submit'
button.
\item Joe is presented with his submitted snippet.
\item Joe logs out.
\end{enumerate}

Note that the walk through above is applicable to a non-registered user
as well. They can miss out the login/logout steps. For restrictions on
non-registered users see Section~\ref{sec:restrict}.

This walk through has highlighted a number of interactions between the
user and the application. It is important to note the order in which
the steps are carried out, particularly the selection of the
programming language and the entering of the code. The order is
important because the selection will dynamically set the syntax
highlighting mode in the application to the language specified.
The text that the user then enters is highlighted according to the
language selected. This highlighting is performed on-demand. % (!)
However, the application will not enforce this ordering on the user.

\section{Application Architecture}

The architecture for the application is a 3-tier architecture as shown
in Figure~\ref{fig:ntier}.
The client (browser) sends HTTP requests to the Django Middleware.
The database and the middleware communicate using Object-relational
mapping (ORM).
The data to be stored includes user details, such as their username,
password and which snippets they have bookmarked; snippet details, such
as its content, the user who created it, the language it was written in,
and its category; ratings information, such as who rated a snippet,
which snippet they rated, and what rating they gave the snippet; and
data on the comments, such as who posted the comment (or anonymous),
which snippet they commented on, and what the comment contained.

The ER diagram for the application is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:erdiag}.
It shows the links between the persistant data within the database.
Snippets are central to all the data, and all of the data is linked
to the snippets. A snippet has a language, a category and the user
who posted the snippet. If the snippet is given a rating, that
rating is linked with the snippet, and the user is linked with the
rating. If a user posts a comment, that comment is linked with the
snippet and user who posted it.

The system is integrated with the Twitter API, allowing a user to
tweet about a snippet they have posted. It will tweet in the format
``A new snippet written in LANGUAGE called NAME has just been submitted!''
Where LANGUAGE is replace by the language it was written in, and NAME
is replaced by the name the user gave to the snippet.

Separation of concerns was imposed in part by the web application
framework used.
Django provides a framework that forces the developer to think in terms
of Model-View-Template. However, this constraint is not restrictive but
enforces a healthy separation of concerns between the components of
the application e.g. URLs, presentation.

In our templates themselves, the JavaScript and CSS stylesheets are
stored in separate files. This means that even within the separate concern
of a template, the concerns revolving around a template (presentation and
dynamic behaviour in this case) are also separated.
Another web framework such as Symfony for PHP could of been used instead,
however it isn't regarded as being nearly as user friendly as Django.

Some advantages of using a web application are:
\begin{itemize}
\item The framework provides a lot of services common to all web
applications, ``out of the box'', meaning that the developer can focus
on features unique to their application rather than spending time
implementing their own login and authentication system, for example.
\item A popular web application framework, like Django, with many
users will have been tested thoroughly so is a better solution than
trying to ``reinvent the wheel'' which would be more likely to
introduce bugs into the web application.
\item It is also the case that the framework will do a lot of setup work
for the developer, reducing ``boilerplate'' code.
\end{itemize}

Some disadvantages of using a web application framework are:

\begin{itemize}
\item The framework will constrain the application to use a particular
development model. For example, Model-View-Template in Django.
\item The documentation and community may be lacking resulting in a
framework making it difficult to learn.
\item There is a trade-off in the time taken to learn the framework
and the benefit of using it. There may be a steep learning curve
involved.
\end{itemize}

\section{Message Parsing}

Figures~\ref{fig:loginseqdiag} and~\ref{fig:postseqdiag} illustrate
sequence diagrams for login and posting a snippet, respectively,
for the walkthrough described in Section~\ref{sec:walkthrough}.
The sequence of requests for logout are similar to that of login so are
not shown. The responses from the middleware are HTML5 responses
(some have client-side Ajax/jQuery/JSON scripts included in them).
All page requests require an ORM request to
the Database to retrieve the top five most recent, and highest rated
code snippets. In addition to these requests, the
``view snippet'' view requests numerous items from the database for
the snippet, to be displayed, and the current user. In this
case, Joe is logged in so a request is made to retrieve his
rating of the viewed snippet, which is zero at the moment since the
snippet was just posted.

To rate a snippet, a logged in user uses the unique rating system for
the application shown in Figure~\ref{fig:joerating}. The display shows
the number of ``Sventeks'' the snippet has been given as an average of
the user ratings. Below the ``Sventeks'' is a description of the current
user's rating of the snippet. A user can change their rating at any time.

The sequence diagram for submitting a rating for snippet with id 19 is
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ratingseqdiag}. The particular sequence is for
a user that is updating their previous rating of the snippet but the
sequence of requests would be similar for a user rating the snippet
for the first time.

Javascript (and the jQuery library), JSON, and Ajax are the
technologies used to dynamically update the rating display when a user
changes their own rating of the snippet. This requires sending the
current user's updated rating of the snippet (after validation) and the
new total rating in a JSON object from the middleware to the client.

In Python, the JSON object looks as follows:

\begin{verbatim}

{"user_rating" : urating,
 "total_rating" : "{}".format(total_rating)}

\end{verbatim}

where \texttt{urating} and \texttt{total\_rating} are the updated user
and total rating respectively.

\section{Implementation Notes}

\subsection{Views}

We implemented the obligatory register/login/logout views and a view called
`user\_view' that displays some public information in a profile page such as
the user's most recent and top rated snippets, languages, and a summary of
activity. This is available for viewing by either clicking on a user's name
or going to your own `Your Profile' link when logged in.

We also implemented views listed below:

\begin{itemize}
\item Homepage - The homepage primarily acts as the page where content
can be added. The user is greeted with a message asking them to post a snippet
which a text box already in focus, waiting for input.

\item View Snippet - This is the complementary view to the 
homepage. This view displays the title, a brief summary, and the code for a 
code snippet. This page also gives a logged in user the ability to rate,
comment, or tweet the snippet.

\item Search  -These two views are our
two search mechanisms. The first allows a standard keyword search on snippet
names. The latter allows for keyword, category, and language specific searching.

\item Browse -
These snippets allow the user to search all snippets that fall under a certain
language or category.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{URL Mapping}

Our application is comprised of three apps: accounts, registration, and
codesnippet. 

Registration has a single URL `/registration/' that handles the
simple form required to become a member of the website.

Accounts handles the login, logout, and profile view via the URLs:
`/accounts/login', `/accounts/logout', and `/accounts/view/<user id>'
respectively.

The Codesnippet app's URL mappings are equally as readable. All URLs, again,
begin with `/codesnippet/' (not required to get to homepage). Postfixes for
search and advanced search are `search/' and `advanced\_search/' respectively.
This is similar for browse (by language/category) with
 `/browse/language|category/<language>|<category>/'. Also, to view a snippet
the URL the postfix is `view/<snippetID>/'.

\subsection{External Service}

Our sole external service is with the Twitter API. A Python package
python-twitter is available that prevents the developers wishing to use the
API from having to write any handler code.

\subsection{Functionality implemented and known issues}

All primary functionality stated earlier in the report has been implemented and
there are no known issues at time of writing.

\subsection{Technologies Used}

\begin{itemize}
\item HTML (HTML5 backwards compatible with HTML4)
\item CSS (Mostly CSS2 with some non-essential CSS3 such as border-radius)
\item Javascript/jQuery - Required to work CodeMirror's syntax highlighting,
for detecting a low resolution display and changing the CSS, and for the JSON
rating system.
\item Python + Django
\item SQLite (although should be replaced by MySQL or similar)
\end{itemize}

\section{Summary and Future Work}

CodeBuzz is a code snippet oriented application that allows users to submit code
in a variety of programming languages. Through categories and languages,
the site provides users with the ability to search for code snippets.
Code snippets can be rated and, if a user has registered, commented on.
Most of the functionality specified in the
Section~\ref{sec:functionality} has been implemented and the appearance
of the application adheres very closely to the wireframes.

Allowing languages or categories to be added by users of the site is
currently not supported.
Currently, the application only supports Twitter but future work could
extend on this to support Facebook integration. A language syntax
detection mechanism could developed.
