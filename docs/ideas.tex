\subsection{The Noob Persona}
% CMCL went with some suggestions from
% http://www.steptwo.com.au/papers/kmc_personas/index.html
% eliminating the personal details and just detailing the following:
% userâ€™s goals, behaviours, likes and dislikes. 

This person is a beginning or amateur programmer perhaps studying a
computing course although could be a hobbyist. Their behaviour includes:

\subsubsection{Goals}

\begin{itemize}
\item Finding code snippets to perform a specific programming task,
e.g. reading from a file.
\item Looking for code on a particular language.
\item To download/copy the code snippet for integration into their
program.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Behaviours}

\begin{itemize}
\item Curiosity towards others code for inspiration for their own code
development. Looking for ideas on, "How it's done", etc.
\item Impatient regarding the "slowness" of their learning, wanting to
get their application up and running as soon as possible. Quick and
dirty.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Likes}

\begin{itemize}
\item When code works out of the box.
\item Easy-to-read code, using simple constructs and ideas so that it
is simple to digest.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Dislikes}

\begin{itemize}
\item Being unable to find the desired code snippet, or one which is
too complex/advanced for their current abilities.
\item Being overwhelmed by large number advanced search capabilities.
\end{itemize}
