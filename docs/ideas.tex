\section{Introduction}

NoteBee is a code snippet oriented application that allows users to submit code 
in a variety of programming languages. This code is categorised based on the
code's language, and function (e.g. sorting algorithm). This categorisation
will allow other users to search for code snippets (e.g. Python Bubble Sort)
and have returned to them a list of matching snippets. These can be ordered
by popularity or user rating.

When a user views a code snippet they have the option to copy the snippet into
their clipboard or comment and rate the snippet.

The application can be used by novice coders looking for examples of common
language functions and can be used by intermediate/expert programmers to supply
their own examples, and rate others. Academics may also find this of use as
it can provide a convenient source of example code (which may or may not be
good code, both useful in this context).

\section{Functionality}

\begin{itemize}
\item Code snippets have their syntax highlighted.
\item User comments on the correctness/usefulness of the code snippets.
\item User rating (in extension to the comments)
\item Note hit rate/popularity.
\item Categorised code snippets by language and function.
\item Ability to search for code snippets based on language and function.
\item Textual copy-to-clipboard.
\item Downloadable source code.
\item Social network integration.
\item Links to other notes.
\end{itemize}

\section{Personas}


\subsection{The Noob Programmer}
% CMCL went with some suggestions from
% http://www.steptwo.com.au/papers/kmc_personas/index.html
% eliminating the personal details and just detailing the following:
% userâ€™s goals, behaviours, likes and dislikes. 

This person is a beginning or amateur programmer perhaps studying a
computing course although could be a hobbyist. Their behaviour includes:

\subsubsection{Goals}

\begin{itemize}
\item Finding code snippets to perform a specific programming task,
e.g. reading from a file.
\item Looking for code on a particular language.
\item To download/copy the code snippet for integration into their
program.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Behaviours}

\begin{itemize}
\item Curiosity towards others code for inspiration for their own code
development. Looking for ideas on, "How it's done", etc.
\item Impatient regarding the "slowness" of their learning, wanting to
get their application up and running as soon as possible. Quick and
dirty.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Likes}

\begin{itemize}
\item When code works out of the box.
\item Easy-to-read code, using simple constructs and ideas so that it
is simple to digest.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Dislikes}

\begin{itemize}
\item Being unable to find the desired code snippet, or one which is
too complex/advanced for their current abilities.
\item Being overwhelmed by large number advanced search capabilities.
\end{itemize}
