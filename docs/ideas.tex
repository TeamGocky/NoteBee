\section*{Abstract}

This report documents the specification and design of CodeBuzz,
a web-application for posting code snippets. The aim of the application is
to facilitate programming language learning by exposing beginners to
example programs written by industry experts and academics, and to
aid reuse by providing a store of solutions to commonly recurring
problems in software engineering.

\section{Introduction}

CodeBuzz is a code snippet oriented application that allows users to submit code
in a variety of programming languages. This code is categorised based on the
code's language, and function (e.g. sorting algorithm). This categorisation
will allow other users to search for code snippets (e.g. Python Bubble Sort)
and have returned to them a list of matching snippets. These can be ordered
by popularity or user rating.

When a user views a code snippet they have the option to copy the snippet into
their clipboard or comment and rate the snippet.

The application can be used by novice coders looking for examples of common
language functions and can be used by intermediate/expert programmers to supply
their own examples, and rate others. Academics may also find this of use as
it can provide a convenient source of example code (which may or may not be
good code, both useful in this context).

\section{Functionality}

The site will operate similar to any collaborative web-based application
where users of the site need not be registered in order to contribute
to the site content. The functionality is detailed in the lists below.

The following functionality is available to both registered and
non-registered users:

\begin{itemize}
\item Code snippets have their syntax highlighted.
\item Snippet hit rate/popularity.
\item Categorised code snippets by language and function.
\item Ability to search for code snippets based on language and
function.
\item Textual copy-to-clipboard.
\item Downloadable source code.
\item Links to other code snippets.
\end{itemize}

The following functionality is only available to registered users:
\label{sec:restrict}

\begin{itemize}
\item User can comment on the code snippets, e.g. reviewing the
correctness/usefulness of the code snippet.
\item User can rate a code snippet on a five star scale.
\item User profile which stores bookmarked snippets.
\item Social network integration.
\end{itemize}

\section{Application Design Ideas}

\subsection{Wireframes}

Figure \ref{fig:blankPage} shows what the user will be greeted with when they
first access the page. The large blank text box is there to try and have the
user contribute to the code database.

Figure \ref{fig:anonsnippet} shows an anonymous snippet being posted by a
visitor to the website who has chosen not to log in. An example of the basic
layout and the syntax highlighting capabilities are shown in the figure.

Figure \ref{fig:joe} shows a logged in user posting a snippet. The user's
name is shown and there are also links to his profile, bookmarks, and other
user-specific data.

Figure \ref{fig:LoggedInViewJane} shows a user called Jane logged in and viewing
a snippet posted by an anonymous user. There is rating and comments section
with a text box for Jane to add in her own comment if she wishes. The page
scrolls as the comments are not necessarily immediately available above the
fold.

Figure \ref{fig:viewCategories} shows a user called Jane logged in and viewing
the snippet categories. Snippets fit into two categories: language, and type.
The view is identical if the user isn't logged in, with the obvious exception
of the upper bar. The upper bar would look like what was shown in Figure
\ref{fig:anonsnippet}.

Figure \ref{fig:viewAfterSubmission} shows a user called Joe viewing a snippet
he has just posted.

\caption{Joe looking at his most recent snippet after submission.}
\label{fig:viewAfterSubmission}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Design Goals}

The number one design goal is to make the user interface minimalist
such that the user is not overwhelmed by the application. As can be
seen in the wire frames described above, the application will have a simple
home screen both for registered and non-registered users.

\newpage

\subsection{A Walk through: Submit a code snippet in C}

A simple walk through for the user Joe entering his C code snippet as
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:joe} is given below:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Joe is presented with the blank home screen and is not currently logged
in.
\item Joe logs in using his user details.
\item Joe is presented with the home screen again.
\item Joe selects the C programming language from the language drop-down
menu.
\item Joe proceeds to write his C code into the main window.
\item Joe selects the `Data Structures' category from the category
drop-down menu.
\item Joe is finished creating his code snippet and clicks the `Submit'
button.
\item Joe is presented with his submitted snippet.
\item Joe logs out.
\end{enumerate}

Note that the walk through above is applicable to a non-registered user
as well. They can skip straight to item 1 to 3. For restrictions on non-
registered users see Section~\ref{sec:restrict}.

This walk through has highlighted a number of interactions between the
user and the application. It is important to note the order in which
the steps are carried out, particularly the selection of the
programming language and the entering of the code. The order is
important because the selection will dynamically set the syntax
highlighting mode in the application to the language specified.
The text that the user then enters is highlighted according to the
language selected. This highlighting is performed on-demand. % (!)
However, the application will not enforce this ordering on the user.

\section{Personas}

\subsection{Barry: The Noob Programmer}
\label{sec:barry} 

Barry is sixteen, studying a computing based course and is looking to
learn a particular language. Barry's programming ability is, at best,
amateur. He relies heavily on introductory texts and Internet forums
since his school does not provide learning materials for the language
of interest.

\begin{itemize}
\item Finding code snippets to perform a specific programming task,
e.g. reading from a file.

Source community.
\item Gives low ratings and disapproving comments to incorrect,
inefficient or ugly code snippets to discourage beginners from
adopting poor techniques or bad programming habits.
\end{itemize}
